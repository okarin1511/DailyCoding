### DAY-2:

#### Problem: Modular multiplicative inverse

Given two integers ‘a’ and ‘m’, find modular multiplicative inverse of ‘a’ under modulo ‘m’.
The modular multiplicative inverse is an integer ‘x’ such that. 

a x ≅ 1 (mod m)
The value of x should be in {0, 1, 2, … m-1}, i.e., in the range of integer modulo m.
The multiplicative inverse of “a modulo m” exists if and only if a and m are relatively prime (i.e., if gcd(a, m) = 1).

### DAY-8: 

#### Problem: Merge Sort

Like QuickSort, Merge Sort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. 
It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves. 
The merge() function is used for merging two halves. 
The merge(arr, l, m, r) is a key process that assumes that arr[l..m] and arr[m+1..r] are sorted and merges the two sorted sub-arrays into one. 
See the following C implementation for details.
